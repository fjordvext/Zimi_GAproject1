# Zimi Proposal

## What is Zimi?

Zimi is a kind of Pokemon-type card game my oldest son Zephyr (age 9) made up last year. He draws his own monster trading cards and he got a bunch of friends at school to join in with him in making them. I want to gamify his cards in a new way to take his game to a new level and be the DAD OF THE YEAR while modelling positive creative behavior for him and my youngest son.

I'm basing the gameplay on a card game that swept my high school in the 90's which I learned as "del-dai", but which I've learned is also called "Big Two", "Deuces", or "Chinese Poker". But I plan to adapt it with original drawings by my sons and making it feel like a game where you pit pocket monsters against each other.

Here's a link to a flowchart showing how I envision the gameplay:

And here's some whiteboard drawings I made of game screens (I'm thinking mobile-first)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

Oh this is gonna be really challenging. First of all, it's going to require programming a computer opponent, which I haven't done yet and I don't think will be easy. I'm also going to have to figure out how to teach the rules of poker to a program, and how to drag and drop cards, and how to make it look smashing (which with my CSS might be an issue) and a bunch of other stuff. AND I have to get my kids to do the art for it and pose for some images I'd like to use in the game, which (if you know 9 year olds and 6 year olds you might be aware) is very much a cat-herding procedure. But I know the game would be fun and I think I could make something REALLLLY COOL.

## Phases of Completion

Phase 0: element gathering
Getting the cards and background images made, boning up on the CSS and jQuery I think I'll need to complete it)

Phase 1: working out screen designs
I think step one (especially for me) will be figuring out how I can make the two main game screens look really good. I have a vision in my head of how I want it to look, and I want to see how close to it I can come. I'll work out mockups in photoshop and then try to recreate it as best I can with CSS.

Phase 2: working out game logic
I have to figure out how to teach a program the value of a pack of cards, which is easy enough for single cards, but gets more complex when you figure in 5 card hands and stuff like that. 

Phase 3: working out game mechanics
How to drag and drop cards, what to do if people choose the wrong cards, how to make cards not in the deck array anymore disappear... lots of little questions to answer.

Phase 4: how to make a computer opponent
Oh boy. That's gonna be something. But as someone super focused on making a career in Artificial Intelligence design, that might be one of the most important things I could do.

## Links and Resources

Some things about Big Two I've been able to find:

There seems to be some versions of Big 2 as computer games and apps, but I think bringing in the homemade pokemon thing is going to make it feel very different:
